bootcamp_module2_vba
In this homework, I analyzed a large data set using VBA. I utilized the VBA loop feature to have each page of data analyzed without having to rewrite the code everytime. I utilized the bootcamps's xpert ai assistant, class recordings, and microsoft support to help me complete this challenge.
